# **Project Description**

This staffing issue represents the 3rd phase of the **Improving Compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act** project. Phase 3 is awaiting PAB approval.

- Client [agency/agencies]: TTS / 10x
- Phase 3 $650k Development
- Important documents: [README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5Ea-vC9gl6etRIFI0iD7DtMbqme8lx9_UrXNBTPDQI/edit#heading=h.qbz9dyqr0zu9)

*Original 10x Pitch:*

"Agencies often cite frustration with accessing and understanding the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) policies on the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), which are spread across numerous inaccessible PDFs rather than centralized on an easily accessible, easily updatable website. This situation has reduced compliance and created delays in the approval of information collection requests (ICRs) by OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which is charged with overseeing federal compliance with the PRA. Through outreach to PRA desk officers and agency staff, and in consultation with OIRA, TTS will explore what it would take to develop centralized PRA guidance in an accessible, user-friendly online interface in order to improve the way agencies can understand, interact, and comply with current OMB policies."

In [Phase 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGolKrn25i8n6vWov4IFKjI_GRD3wO-fJ0hcx6_cSdQ/edit), the project team conducted preliminary research and interviewed PRA stakeholders from over 20 different agencies and recommended that this project continue onto phase 2. The Phase 2 Team continued the project's initial research and, working closely with OIRA, decided to narrow the problem scope to focus on one of the PRA user groups: those folks at small agencies ( that do not have dedicated PRA support) who are novices to PRA-related issues and who need to know whether or not a process they plan to implement requires PRA clearance. The team developed and tested a prototype of a digital tool that provides such guidance and, again working with OIRA, recommended that this project proceed to Phase 3.

Phase 3 will focus on the following:

- Continue iterating, testing, and launching the current prototype
- Work with OIRA to agree on guidance to be published
- Address the burdens faced by other PRA users beyond the initial userbase (PRA novices at small agencies who need to know whether or not a process they plan to implement requires PRA clearance)
- Craft content for the digital tool that is both written in plainlanguage and acceptable for OIRA's legal team
- Help OIRA market the new tool across the government
