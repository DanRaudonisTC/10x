### Project Description

**10x Pitch** 

*60.6 million Americans are not fluent in English. Despite this, most Federal web content is only available in English. Having content available in multiple languages will make the information we produce more accessible to the members of the public whose primary language is not English. This can be done with existing open source tools for delivering localized content such as Pootle and gettext. TTS will investigate whether translation services could be shared as a GSA-sponsored service or as a reusable playbook.*

This staffing issue represents the continuation of phase 2 of this project. The original phase 2 team conducted and synthesized excellent research, and with the remaining project budget we are requesting a new team to explore some of the follow-on questions raised after the original report. 

Further context can be found in the [Phase 1 report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkOpvhNiMdkT73dv5-oefKPSSuomfGUY3DIeq9hx5vA/edit#) and the [Phase 2 report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQzPoHqyatQ_34nHRIMlICq5W9hU2jQtaZxWb0_q770/edit?ts=5b87f4ac#heading=h.c328ofidivft)

**Tasks/Goals for this phase of the project are to answer the following questions that arose after the Phase 2 report**

• In the original Phase 2 report, Trados was identified as an existing product in the market that serves the needs of large agencies well. We would like more exploration to understand the needs of small/medium agencies and organizations in order to determine whether or not they are currently using or able to use Trados. Do they have an existing need for it, resources to obtain it, or any significant barriers to obtaining a Trados license, and if so what are they?

• A single, government-wide language glossary is impractical but smaller topic-focused glossaries have been successful in some contexts outside government. Is there a better way to manage or split glossaries for government, or any other sort of approach that could prove valuable?

• If we were to support organizations using Trados, what kinds of tools would increase their efficiency? For example, would import and export tools be useful?

• Is there value in building some sort of internal translation tool that differed from Trados in a meaningful way? What would be different about it in order to justify the work? What features and properties would this sort of MVP translation service have?

• Were we to determine there would be value in building some sort of internal translation tool that differed from Trados in a meaningful way, what are the range of options available to us for sustaining it long-term (ie, cost-recoverability, appropriated funds inside TTS, appropriated funds outside TTS, or some other funding or support mechanism)?
