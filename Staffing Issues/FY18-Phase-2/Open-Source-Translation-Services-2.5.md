### Project Description

**10x Pitch** 

*60.6 million Americans are not fluent in English. Despite this, most Federal web content is only available in English. Having content available in multiple languages will make the information we produce more accessible to the members of the public whose primary language is not English. This can be done with existing open source tools for delivering localized content such as Pootle and gettext. TTS will investigate whether translation services could be shared as a GSA-sponsored service or as a reusable playbook.*

This staffing issue represents the continuation of phase 2 of this project. While the team conducted and synthesized excellent research, we are requesting staff for a new team to explore some remaining questions. 

Further context can be found in the [Phase 1 report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkOpvhNiMdkT73dv5-oefKPSSuomfGUY3DIeq9hx5vA/edit#) and the [Phase 2 report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQzPoHqyatQ_34nHRIMlICq5W9hU2jQtaZxWb0_q770/edit?ts=5b87f4ac#heading=h.c328ofidivft)

**Tasks/Goals for this phase of the project project are to answer the following questions, based on the Phase 2 report**

• While larger organizations' needs fit well with Trados' use case, what are the needs of small/medium organizations that don't have a need or resources for a Trados license?

• A single, government-wide glossary is impractical but smaller topic-focused glossaries have been successful. What is the right way to split glossaries for government?

• If we were to support organizaitons using Trados, what kinds of tools would increase efficiency? Import/export tools?

• What features/properties would an MVP Translation Service have and what would be it's path to cost recoverability?
