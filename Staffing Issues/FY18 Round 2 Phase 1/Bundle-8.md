## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x5)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) exploring how technology could give citizens more control over their data while also making it easier to share and verify transactions with both public-sector agencies and private-sector companies, 2) exploring how technology could provide instantaneous notification to participating organizations about scientific proposal information determined to be the most valuable for sharing across organizations, 3) building a common, compliant, and resilient service for large file management and transfer across agencies, 4) identifying common challenges facing municipalities that impede their ability to transfer data to the federal government, and investigating how the Federal government might build infrastructural solutions to ensure more effective data transfer, and 5) building guidelines and inexpensive tools for preserving government websites in a way that is transparent and publicly accessible after sites are sunsetted.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Verifying Cross-Sector Transactions*. The federal government collects and maintains a large amount of data about private citizens, much of which is useful and necessary for transactions both in the public sphere and the private sector such as applying for a government benefit, a loan, or a new job. Using this data today requires transactions that are frequently onerous, expensive, and paper-based. TTS will explore how technology could give citizens more control over their data while also making it easier to share and verify transactions with both public-sector agencies and private-sector companies.
  * *Reducing Duplication in Research Grants*. Scientific grants have been an indispensable source of innovation for decades. However, duplicative and overlapping grants is a serious issue that impedes scientific progress. TTS, in conjunction with subject matter experts from the National Science Foundation (NSF), will explore how technology could provide instantaneous notification to participating organizations about proposal information determined to be the most valuable for sharing across organizations. This could eventually allow for a continuous flow of updated information with respect to proposals, including a “proposal fingerprint,” associated metadata, and record of changes in status of the proposal/grant in an organization’s merit review systems.
  * *Large File Management*. Agencies struggle to transfer and manage data files too large for email, especially when receiving large dataset uploads from non-federal partners. Some agencies courier thumb drives or hard drives to each other. TTS should investigate the feasibility of a common, compliant, and resilient service for large file management and transfer.
  * *Municipal Data Products*. Federal agencies should be able to better leverage existing at the municipal and state level that is generated via federal programs and funding, in order to determine the effectiveness of the federal programs that generate this data and in order to be able to get greater value and impact out of this data at the federal level. Despite various attempts to bridge the gap between local and federal data operations, both sides struggle to effectively connect in order to make this exchange of data viable. TTS will explore the common challenges facing municipalities that impede their ability to transfer this data to the federal government, and investigate how the Federal government might build infrastructural solutions to ensure more effective data transfer. 
  * *The Sunset Vault*. With changes in funding or project needs, government websites often get shut down without a good digital archival plan. This may lead to program offices scrambling to figure out how to archive and shut down websites in ways that mean the public loses easy access to data. TTS will explore building guidelines and inexpensive tools for preserving government websites in a way that is transparent and publicly accessible after sites are sunsetted. In addition, TTS will provide guidance on how to build and govern websites in a way that are more easy to archive and sunset so their information is still accessible to the public.
