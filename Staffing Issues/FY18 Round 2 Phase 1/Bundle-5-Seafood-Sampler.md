## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x4)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) creating tools and practices designed to recuit a diverse workforce, 2) investing in tools and processes that streamline and improve the federal hiring process, 3) investing in and accelerating the 18F writing lab beyond TTS, and 4) developing an immersive, hands-on innovation program for for federal technology executives.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Talent Diversity Tooling*. Identifying, recruiting, and hiring top talent from underrepresented backgrounds should be a top priority for the federal government. This project will explore practices, tools, and strategies that could help achieve that goal, which could include but are not limited to recruitment platforms that create candidate profiles based on identifiers such as veteran status and gender as well as skill assessment exercises for job applicants.
  * *Applicant Tracking System*. Talent acquisition teams within the federal government face regulation, complexity, and insufficient tooling, which can ultimately impede an organization's ability to identify and acquire critical talent. This project will investigate opportunities to develop a way to capture, organize, and maintain the data and transactions related to talent acquisition in order to increase the efficiency and efficacy of talent operations. This research will help TTS understand if there is an opportunity to develop a new or leverage an existing solution that meets the nuanced requirements of federal hiring while still delivering the functionality and user experience necessary to decrease the time, effort, and cost involved in federal hiring.
  * *Writing Lab beyond 18F*. The 18F Writing Lab has proven to be a great resource for TTS. Time-limited research to identify areas for iteration, improvement, and expansion of the lab have been conducted. At present, however, the capacity to develop this service for other federal agencies has been limited by lack of resources. TTS will explore opportunities to improve the lab’s services in order to expand its availability to other parts of government.
  * *IT Innovation Program for Federal Executives*. This is a proposal to investigate and measure the value of an immersive, “hands-on” innovation program for federal technology executives to explore opportunities to reduce IT costs and in the building and acquisition of redundant technology systems. Building off from and amplifying existing initiatives such as innovation.gov, The Digital Acquisition Accelerator, the Department of Homeland Security’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program, and code.gov, TTS will explore the value of experiential and culture-driven approaches toward innovation initiatives for executives, using proven methodologies from within all agencies and industry-leading techniques adopted by and currently applied within the private sector.
