## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x4)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) creating a library of common interaction patterns for agency visualization needs, 2) providing agencies with open-source visual assets, 3) creating a form for the public to identify poor government web practices and elevate them to agencies, and 4) providing digital-native versions of conventional forms to agencies.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Reusable Patterns for Data Visualization*. Successful government projects often rely on bespoke, sophisticated data visualization work. However, convincing agency partners to invest in this kind of work can be a challenge — especially when the alternative, publishing reports as PDFs, is relatively easy though significantly less useful. Inspired by the U.S. Web Design System, TTS will explore creating a library of common interaction patterns designed to make data visualization a cheaper, simpler, and more compelling choice for the federal government.
  * *Open Source Visualizations*. Consistency and communication in government could be improved by providing reliable access to well-built, practical, easy-to-use visual assets. TTS will explore what it would take to develop a limited set of open source visualizations (icons, patterns, or illustrations) that could be included with the U.S. Web Design Standards and Federalist, available for independent use by any government team or project.
  * *Antipattern Reporting*. An antipattern is defined as “a commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences.” Everyday, Americans regularly complain online about antipatterns on specific government websites, but there is no way for federal leaders to track which sites’ technical and user experience flaws are causing the most frustration for the public. This project will explore the value of creating a form for the public to identify poor government web practices, along with a mechanism to escalate repeatedly submitted sites to agency CIOs and oversight staff.
  * *Digital-Native Forms*. GSA's Standard and Optional Forms Management Program seeks to "achieve government-wide economies and efficiencies through the development, maintenance, and common use of conventional forms," yet these forms are only available as PDFs. This project will explore how digital-native versions of these forms might yield operational efficiencies and improve the user experience of government.
