## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x4)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) coordinating with agencies that are preparing to deprecate support for older browsers that might negatively affect the public, 2) investigating toolkits, methodologies, and approaches for facilitating the automatic generation of API’s from code, 3) investigating approaches to facilitating the development of sustainable APIs across the federal government, and 4) investigating the opportunity to provide a shared service for processing HTML forms on government websites, particularly on static websites that do not have access to underlying backend technologies.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Accessibility for Deprecated Browsers*. OMB memo M-15-13 requires all publicly accessible Federal websites and web services to only provide service through a secure connection (HTTPS). Recently, some federal agencies also deprecated support for the HTTPS protocol TLS 1.0, effectively blocking any internet device using Android 4.3 or IE10 (used in ~2.6 million government website visits in the last 90 days) from accessing government services like hurricane warnings. TTS will investigate the user base that is being denied service (which is likely minimally equipped to petition the government) in order to determine how best to communicate critical information about this user base to agencies as they consider the impact of blocking access to legacy browsing devices.
  * *Code2API*. There is a growing amount of code being generated across government, but much of this code is not API-based. This project will investigate potential toolkits, methodologies, and approaches for facilitating the automatic generation of API’s from code (and sample simple apps) that allows for quick prototyping, deployment, and user feedback.
  * *Sustainable APIs*. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have changed how government technology services are provided. However, programs that use APIs, and particularly those developed by federal agencies that are typically used by third parties, can break as new API versions are released. TTS will investigate approaches to facilitating the development of sustainable APIs across the federal government that are more resilient in the face of ongoing development.
  * *HTML Form Endpoint*. As an organization, TTS recommends the use of static websites but does not currently provide a way of collecting feedback from the public without the use of Google Forms or providing a direct email address and relying on the user to have a properly configured email client. Allowing customized HTML forms could increase usability and improve the public’s experience with the government. TTS will investigate the opportunity to provide a shared service for processing HTML forms on government websites, particularly on static websites that do not have access to underlying backend technologies, such as Federalist.
