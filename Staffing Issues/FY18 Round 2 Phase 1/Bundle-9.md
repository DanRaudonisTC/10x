## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x5)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to scan government websites for accessibility issues, 2) using artificial intelligence to assist government agency staff in writing contracts, 3) applying machine learning to analyze reams of data and automatically detect anomalies in security logs, 4) finding ways to streamline and accelerate the authorization processes at agencies and identify some standard practices to share, and 5) follow-up with people who have reported scams to the government in order to continue the reporting process or automating the process altogether.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *AI for Website Accessibility*. This project will explore the viability of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to scan government websites for accessibility issues in order to automate the creation of copies of non-compliant sites with the issues either resolved or flagged for human intervention.
  * *AI-Assisted Contracts*. This project will explore how artificial Intelligence might assist government agency staff in writing contracts. Potential areas to explore include but are not limited to translating generalized ideas into formal language, inserting mandated language where appropriate, and flagging when a document warrants expert human review.
  * *Automated Monitoring for Security Logs*. In theory, compliance regimes require organizations to monitor security logs (authorization logs, etc). In practice, most groups do this rarely if at all because it's exceedingly rare to discover intrusions through manual log analysis because the sheer quantity of data involved is too great for manual review to be valuable. TTS will explore the opportunity to apply machine learning in order to analyze reams of data and automatically detect anomalies, looking into commercially available security products that claim to do this and available open-source tooling as well.
  * *RPA (Robotic Process Automation) for ATOs*. The government lacks a comprehensive view across agencies on which portions of the Authority-to-Operate (ATO) process impose the most burden. Reading the documentation can be time consuming, and security practitioners often speak to the significant challenges that exist with current tools — for example, the requirements to copy and paste information across systems or manually enter data when it could be automated. TTS will investigate ways to streamline and accelerate the authorization processes at agencies and identify some standard practices to share. 
  * *Scam Reporting Follow-Up*. When people call the USAGov call center to report a scam, they are provided the phone number of the agency with which to file the actual complaint. Existing data shows that there's a drop off point when members of the public choose not to continue with the scam reporting process. TTS will explore whether or not there’s an opportunity to follow-up with people in order to continue the reporting process or potentially automate that process altogether. This could result in a simpler and more effective scam reporting process that would benefit both the public and federal agencies.
