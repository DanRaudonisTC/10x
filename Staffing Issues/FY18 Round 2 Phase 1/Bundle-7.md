## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x4)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) providing a common self-service, cloud-based solution for .gov redirects at the DNS, HTTPS, and server layers, 2) creating a scanning service that examines federal websites and provides feedback to agencies based on feedback tools, USWDS adoption, and security pratcies, 3) offering a temporary, self-service domain name and DNS provisioning system, and 4) building a "website composition kit" or layer that sits on top of Federalist and GitHub and the U.S. Web Design System that could provide government teams with the means to easily create, edit and compose small, focused websites.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Site Redirects*. According to an analysis of 200 random .gov domains, 18% are redirects to other sites. Because of limitations for most DNS providers, many redirects must be hosted at static IP addresses on legacy off-cloud servers where managing HTTPS certificates is challenging and expensive. TTS will investigate the opportunity to provide a common self-service, cloud-based solution for .gov redirects at the DNS, HTTPS, and server layers.
  * *Site Scanning*. TTS drives the adoption of digital best practices and policy, from mobile-friendliness to online privacy and security, but currently lacks comprehensive, timely data to measure our success at seeing these approaches adopted. TTS will explore the possibility of creating a scanning service that examines federal websites, then analyzes and presents actionable intelligence based on the presence of web trackers and customer feedback tools, USWDS adoption, and security best practices.
  * *Temporary Sub-domains*. Top level .gov domains are hard to obtain; however, teams across agencies often need temporary domains to host information or events, especially interagency task forces and groups that cannot be linked to a subdomain of a major agency to maintain interagency trust. TTS will explore offering a temporary, self-service domain name and DNS provisioning system, enabling agencies to rapidly deploy new sub-domains for their efforts under a neutral first tier domain title.
  * *CodeKit*. Starting a new, small website in government is challenging. Platforms like Federalist make it easier to host and manage your site but don't currently offer teams the tools or workflow guidance needed to configure and compose templates to fit a teamâ€™s mission. Existing research done by DigitalGov and the US Web Design System has identified an opportunity to build a "website composition kit" or layer that sits on top of Federalist and GitHub and the U.S. Web Design System that could provide government teams with the means to easily create, edit and compose small, focused websites that are compliant and maintainable in the open. This project will explore the viability of building out this website composition kit.
