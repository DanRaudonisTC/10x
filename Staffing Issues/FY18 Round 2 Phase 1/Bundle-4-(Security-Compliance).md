## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x4)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) reducing the burden for small and medium-sized firms to move through the FedRAMP process, 2) identifying standards for compliant IT tooling across agencies, 3) monitoring certificates to check for the validity of .gov domains across the government, and 4) evaluating whether or not FedRAMP requirements are beyond compliance frameworks such as ISO and HIPAA.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *Security Compliance Angel Investors*. Security compliance is a massive obstacle for modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, particularly small-to-medium-sized ones, to sell to the federal government. TTS will explore ways to reduce the burden, via funding or other assistance, on small and medium-sized cloud providers that want to enter the federal marketplace, with the goal of increasing incentive and lowering risk for these companies to go through FedRAMP.
  * *Trusted Tooling for IT Compliance*. TTS will explore collaboration with IT compliance officers and auditors across the federal government to identify what constitutes trusted tooling, what they need to learn to use new tooling effectively, and how institutional or cultural hurdles to adopting automated compliance can be removed.
  * *Certificate Transparency*. The future of assurance for HTTPS certificates is certificate transparency, an initiative piloted and adopted by Mozilla, Apple, and all major browsers. The project will explore ways to monitor all certificates from all sources to check for validity of .gov domain certificates. 
  * *Compliance Gap Analysis*. Cloud service vendors looking to do business with the government frequently complain to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) that the FedRAMP process imposes additional compliance requirements on top of existing requirements like those mandated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). TTS will conduct research to validate or invalidate this assertion with the goal of identifying any unique FedRAMP requirements that are beyond compliance frameworks such as ISO and HIPAA.
