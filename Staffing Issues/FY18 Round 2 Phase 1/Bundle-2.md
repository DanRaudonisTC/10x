## Project Description

* **Client:** OPP / 10x
* **Engagement Type:** Phase 1 $20k Investigation (x5)
* **Problem to be solved:** TTS will explore the possibility of 1) establishing metrics for government IT modernization, 2) evaluating the adoption of best practices on design across government digital products, 3) establishing canonical identifiers for federal offices and programs, 4) building a tool that houses cross-program data for OPP, and 5) providing agencies with support on establishing analytics dashboards.
* **Original Pitches:**
  * *IT Modernization Metrics*. While GSA hopes to disrupt agency paradigms with practices like moving to the cloud, opening up data, and adopting user-centered design, there are few well designed metrics/milestones to understand where the agencies are at on this path to modernization. Some of this information exists buried in different government reports, and presumably some of it hasn't been surfaced at all. The goal of this project would be to understand the state of metrics on IT modernization, what some of these metrics might be, and to determine whether or not it would be useful to create a government-wide service to track these metrics, complementary to performance.gov and analytics.gov.
  * *Metrics for Design Best Practice Adoption*. Best practices for product design can come from anywhere, but government often focuses on the compliance or noncompliance of technology rather than the degree to which it effectively empowers the people doing the work. TTS will explore opportunities and structures for measuring and encouraging best practice adoption across government product teams.
  * *Canonical Federal Identifiers*. There are no canonical standards for how Federal programs and individual offices are identified. Between GSA, OMB, OPM, and Treasury there are at least a half a dozen competing unique identifier schemes to reference a government office, which makes combining multiple systems or datasets incredibly difficult. These multiple efforts are not only potentially duplicative but they introduce even greater inefficiency by generating incompatible data. TTS will explore the opportunity to establish canonical federal identifiers, as well as better governance and data stewardship among these agencies in order to coordinate and maintain this data. This project would research the viability of piloting a workflow to establish a repeatable process to maintain this data as a canonical authoritative source over time.
  * *Program Analytics Dashboard*. The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) has a desire to get DAP data out of Google Analytics, where it currently resides, and into a data warehouse, in order to increase the ease and flexibility with which we could make use of this vast data set. This project will explore using a common tool as a place to house data for multiple cross-government OPP programs — DAP, Search.gov, Feedback Analytics, api.data.gov, data.gov, and challenge.gov — in order to have a single location from which to create both internal and public facing products and dashboards that could be shared with the rest of the government and the American public.
  * *Analytics Dashboard Framework*. This project will explore whether or not it would be valuable to provide tools, methodologies, and governmentwide support for data analytics and visualization dashboards that measure improvement in government performance. Just as the U.S. Web Design Style Guide packages reusable components for front-end web design, this framework could package reusable front and backend components supporting performance analytics dashboards. This could include generalizing the use of the data visualization libraries and the data aggregation/integration approaches employed by existing analytics dashboard projects.
