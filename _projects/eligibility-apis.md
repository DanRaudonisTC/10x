The Eligibility APIs project is exploring how federal agencies could use a centralized web service, or *eligibility API*, to deliver their policy directly to states in a format states' systems can ingest and utilize. We seek to pilot a new model where policy changes at the federal level will be made once, centrally, and will propagate outward to states (rather than states each having to undertake a costly, redundant, time-consuming, error-prone process to update their systems individually). We're partnering with programs at the federal and state levels to understand their unique challenges and to learn how to make this model viable across the wide variety of eligibility-based scenarios.
