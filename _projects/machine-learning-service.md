USA.gov and Gobierno.USA.gov provide a vital service: connecting members of the public with official information about government services. In an effort to better serve the public, both sites collect (and act on) feedback from users. They collect this feedback through various channels: call centers, the chat feature, sitewide surveys, and page-level surveys. (Our research focused almost entirely on page-level surveys.) For context, page-level surveys appear on “nearly every content page, directory record page, and state details page” — in other words, pages with the content that users need to answer their questions.
