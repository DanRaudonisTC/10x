# Welcome to 10x!

This is where the fun begins! The 10x team is here to support and advise you throughout this process. We are here to help your project get everything it needs to succeed. While we manage the process of determining what gets funded, we are not involved in the actual decision-making about whether or not a project should progress to the next stage, which means we are positioned to give your team the greatest possible chance of making a successful funding pitch. 

Don’t hesitate to reach out to us in the #10x Slack channel or in your project Slack channel for support, advice, and encouragement.

Let’s make something together!

—Lane, Nico, and Will

## What’s Phase 1 all about?

**GOAL: “A hard no or a soft yes”**

Designed to quickly uncover the most salient pieces of information about the opportunities and challenges for any idea. Teams of one to two people work together for one to two weeks to develop a high-level understanding of the topic space and provide a final recommendation about whether or not to further develop a product idea. 

Research done during this phase is intended to be directional, not comprehensive — just enough information to say “yes, maybe” or “no, absolutely not.” Links to report templates for both a “yes” and a “no” recommendation can be found at the end of this document.

**Note to 18F/Acq/PIF team members: If your pitch was accepted for Phase One, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be one of the individuals staffed to the project.** Although this can happen, because the goal of the first phase is to determine whether or not the idea submitted is a valid one to pursue, it’s often the case that the best person to make that determination is not the person who initially submitted the idea. But never fear! You’re still the project owner, and will be able to participate in the Phase One project in an oversight and review capacity, and if the project is accepted for Phase Two, we can begin to staff you on the project full-time at that point. (OPP team members don’t bill and therefore only operate in an owner/oversight capacity.)

## The Basics
* We know it’s exciting—we’re excited too!—but don’t start working until the contract has actually been signed.
* Once your agreement has been signed, the 10x Team will create a Slack channel for your project with “10x-[project-name]”
* Be cognisant of project hours / dollars remaining. Because these projects often run on a timeframe that’s shorter than the one the TTS billing system runs on, we won’t be able to catch a project overage until it has already happened. Diligent hours tracking solves this problem.
* For the closeout meeting, you will prepare a findings doc (recommendations on whether to proceed for Phase Two, see Phase One templates below) for Sarah Crane, Assistant Commissioner for OPP. Based on your recommendation and presentation, Sarah will decide whether or not to fund the project into Phase 2.
* When it comes time to start Phase Two, we’ll need your assistance in two areas:
  * An hour of your time to prepare a staffing issue. Anticipate this in your billable hours.
  * An hour of your time to review the Phase Two MOU agreement to make certain that the project description and list of deliverables accurately reflect your intentions for the second phase of the work.
