**10x Investigation Recommendations, [date], [project participants]**

*This Investigation Phase template will serve as a guide for the formal report out on your early investigation findings as well as your reasoning for your “yes” to the question of whether or not we should move forward with work in this area. If your investigation resulted in a conclusion that we should not move forward in this area, please use this template instead.*

*10x requires this report as part of the Investigation close-out process. Projects may choose to develop a slide presentation to accompany their presentation as well. An example of a well-developed report can be found here, and examples of well-developed “yes” slide presentations can be found here, here, and here.*

## Proposal for the Discovery phase
The next phase of 10x project work, Discovery, is intended to gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, product and market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, how you scale, and so on. The team will think comprehensively about what could go right and wrong, and will create an initial strategy around each issue the project may face.

* What is the plan for the discovery phase of work?
  * This should be a narrative description of the overall work that needs to happen, not a project timeline or cost estimate
* What are the differents type of work that the next phase will encompass?
  * Understanding that things may change once the project is in process, please give as detailed a description of what you currently believe needs to be done next.
## Questions the next phase should answer
* What are the questions that you uncovered during this phase of work that will need to be answered in the Discovery phase?
* What are the biggest unknowns facing the project? 
* What are the uncertainties in the project plan that will need to get clarified in order to proceed effectively?
* What are the possible risks associated with this project moving forward?
