### Project Description

**Original 10x Pitch** 

*Each month, approximately 9,000 surveys are submitted through USA.gov and Gobierno.USA.gov. About 2,000 of these include open-ended comments. With current resource limitations, it's challenging to take advantage of this qualitative data. TTS will explore implementing a semi-automated product and/or process, using topic extraction, word/phrase frequencies, or other applications of text analysis, to help quickly respond to user feedback.*
