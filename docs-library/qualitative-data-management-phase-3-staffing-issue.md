### Project Description

This staffing request is for the 3rd phase of the Qualitative Data Management 10x project.

**Original 10x Pitch** 

*Each month, approximately 9,000 surveys are submitted through USA.gov and Gobierno.USA.gov. About 2,000 of these include open-ended comments. With current resource limitations, it's challenging to take advantage of this qualitative data. TTS will explore implementing a semi-automated product and/or process, using topic extraction, word/phrase frequencies, or other applications of text analysis, to help quickly respond to user feedback.*

**Phase 2**

Phase 2 of the project recently concluded, it focused on introducing process improvements for the USAgov team and implementing simple automation in analyzing open-ended comments. The team also developed experimental qualitative data analysis techniques that helped analyze these data with less human intervention. The next phase of the project will focus on translating the current work into a machine learning offering for federal employees across the government.
