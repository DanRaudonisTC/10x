# [Project Title]
**10x Investigation Recommendations, [date], [project participants]**

*This Investigation Phase template will serve as a guide for the formal report out on your early investigation findings as well as your reasoning for your “no” to the question of whether or not we should move forward with work in this area. If your investigation resulted in a conclusion that we should move forward in this area, please use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uf0AukUtMKGe1vaAjA6K1A2vPwYMG5gJMcLYURnEza0/edit#) instead.*

*10x requires this report as part of the Investigation close-out process. Projects may choose to develop a slide presentation to accompany their presentation as well. An example of a well-developed report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1gStrQXQBsZO5XmWT-ThiOTfRet8QJ6Xk5NCZYWmYFNs/edit?usp=sharing), and examples of well-developed “no” slide presentations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fhTcFzEjoJxE6XTY3ZtYqRto8UvECfJ8b2SJG5-GY4U/edit#slide=id.g1d19a7aaf2_0_552) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BzqJjG2G5_mkE3rCpqVP6I3sNI1FzsSw2Czy3Y6Ri0k/edit#slide=id.g1ce106d71a_1_125).*
## Recommendation
* Why do you recommend not moving forward with this project?
* What are the major factors preventing this project from being successful?
## How we arrived at this conclusion
* What kind of research did you do to decide that this was not an appropriate focus for future TTS work at this point in time?
  * If you did market research, explain your methodology and sourcing, and what you learned from this research.
  * If you did user research, explain who you spoke to and what you learned from those conversations.
  * If you did other types of research, include information and conclusions drawn from that here as well.
* Are there other departments in TTS or GSA, or other agencies, that are already doing this type of work?
  * How is this work similar or different from the work that this project was proposing to do? 
  * Why does the work already being done work preclude our team from working in this area as well?
  * Would these agencies benefit from the information that you’ve gathered?
* Are there existing or in-development tools, products, or services that already exist?
  * How are these tools, products, or services similar or different from the work that this project was proposing to do? 
  * Why does the existence of these tools, products, or services preclude our team from working in this area as well?
## Denouement
* What are possible risks associated with this project, if any? 
  * [Common project risk types](https://management.simplicable.com/management/new/22-types-of-project-risk) to consider.
* Is there current demand for this project within the government?
  * If so, why is this demand not enough to consider moving forward with this project?
  * If not, what is your understanding of why demand does not currently exist?
* Do you recommend we should revisit this project in the future?
  * If so, what are the circumstances or variables that would need to change in order to make this a viable TTS project?
  * If so, what is the timeframe in which we should consider this product or service again?
  * If not, why not?
