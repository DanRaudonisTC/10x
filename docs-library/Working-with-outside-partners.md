# Working with 10x 

**For agencies and other departments within the federal government that aren’t a part of TTS.**

Before you do anything else, please read the attached document “10x Investments Call for Ideas” outlining how the 10x process works.

Agencies or departments outside of TTS that are interested in making use of the 10x process for their own ideas have several options for how to do so, outlined below.

## Submitting an idea to the primary 10x process

We welcome ideas from outside agencies and other departments for products and services we could potentially build using the 10x process. The process for doing so is very similar to the one used inside TTS — filling out this form, which asks for no more than two or three sentences answering the question “What problem are you trying to solve?”, as well as some additional questions describing the appropriate point of contact (POC) inside your organization for the work. 

We also ask that you locate a sponsor for the project inside TTS, who can be available to answer any TTS-specific questions we might have about the project itself (and if you don’t already have anyone in mind, contact us at 10x@gsa.gov, and we will work with you to locate someone.)

All ideas submitted, whether from inside or outside TTS, will be considered as a batch, with a select number getting chosen in either Q1 or Q3 of the year, based on the quality of the idea and its relevance to current TTS organizational priorities. Ideas submitted must also conform to the funding authority for the Digital Services Fund (DSF), which requires ideas to be for “new” products and services that are “good-for-government” — ie, will serve either a broad set of agencies, a significant percentage of the American public, or both.

When submitting an idea from outside of TTS to the traditional investment process, it’s important to remember that the actual product being developed is being funded by the Office of Products and Programs (OPP) inside TTS, and that OPP remains the owner of the product; your initial role in submitting an idea is to help OPP understand and prioritize product and service development that has value to your agency and the government at large, but we are not a source of augmentation of funding for outside agencies. 

That said, outside agency participation is critical, and comes in a variety of forms: As the submitter of the idea, and, if selected as the primary Subject Matter Expert (SME) on the topic/idea, your active collaboration on the project is key to ensuring that the work proceeds effectively. This individual also functions as the main POC for the 10x team assigned to work on the project, in order to understand and integrate the requirements and priorities of the participating agency. Though other individuals from the agency will also be involved in the work necessary to fully research and understand and develop the submitted idea, we ask that only one individual function in the role of project SME and POC.

Finally, upon successful execution of an idea through the 10x process, OPP is not necessarily assumed to be the ultimate home for whatever product or service has been developed. We consider a variety of environments to provide ongoing support, and would work with the POC for the project to determine whether or not their department or agency would be an appropriate place to land the product or service once it’s determined whether or not the receiving team has the funding and resources necessary to ensure the product or service’s ongoing development and maintenance.

Interested? Submit your idea via the attached form “Working with 10x Investments: Apply for a $20,000 Investigation Sprint (Outside Agency)”, and return it via email to 10x@gsa.gov. (If the attachment doesn’t work, you can also email us at that address, and we’ll send you a copy to fill out and return.)

## Outside funding for ideas that go through the 10x investment funnel

The 10x investment funnel’s central source of funding is the Digital Services Fund (DSF), part of the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF), managed by the Office of Products and Programs (OPP) inside the Technology Transformation Service (TTS.) However, the process itself is agnostic as to the funding source being used to support initial investigation and subsequent research and development of products and services, and we welcome other departments or agencies using their funding sources to push ideas through the investment funnel.

Our approach to this mirrors the traditional investment process, with two exceptions: One is that the funding source originates elsewhere, which means we work with the agency or team we’re partnering with to manage whatever contractual or inter-agency agreement process is necessary in order to successfully disburse the funds. The second difference is that the organization that pays for the work decides, in consultation with our team, which ideas will be prioritized to put through the investment funnel.

In FY2017, we successfully beta tested this process of using outside funds working with the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) CIO Council team, with ideas that had been generated based on issues that CIOs from across the federal government were grappling with in the areas of effective application of emerging Artificial Intelligence technology in the areas of information security and customer service. 18F provided the team that executed on this work, and we worked with the CIO Council to ensure successful delivery of results.

Costs for this work mirror the costs for funding the projects — $20,000 for the initial investigation, $175,000 for a deeper investigation if warranted, etc. There are no additional costs beyond those that support the work. 

## Building your own 10x process inside your agency or department

We’re very interested in providing consultative services to agencies or departments that have their own funding source that could potentially be made available for new products or services, to assist them in standing up and supporting a 10x-style incremental investment process within their own team. At present, there’s no cost to engaging us for these services.

If that sounds like something your team would be interested in, reach out to us at 10x@gsa.gov and let’s discuss.
