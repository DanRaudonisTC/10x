# 10x Funding Stages

*Throughout this document we will provide a description of each funding stage and what’s usually expected to move on for further funding of your project.*

**10x exists to invest in products that possess paradigm-changing ideas or technology with the potential to deliver massive value (at least “10 times” the value of the initial investment) to the federal government or the American public.**

10x is the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund (DSF), a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF) designated to support new, good-for-government products and services. 10x invests the money appropriated into this fund into ideas with the potential for significant impact, and monitors and supports these investments through ideation, development, and ultimately into a successful “exit,” either within TTS, with another part of GSA, or supported by another agency.

What exactly are we looking for? We are looking for ideas with the perfect storm of desirable attributes and evidence of the following:

* Your project fits into the TTS strategy, and is properly situated underneath one of our current “areas of focus”
* Your project is in a big or rapidly growing market within the federal government
* Your project has the potential to support not just the federal government landscape but can also bring value to the federal contracting ecosystem
* Your product or service is truly disruptive and unique
* Your team is ready, willing, and capable of taking on the significant undertaking that is developing, deploying, and scaling a new product or service within the federal bureaucracy

**Identifying Risks**

Risk is an inherent element and is at its highest in early-stage projects, where a high degree of uncertainty exists about whether the product will work or not. Risks (or opportunities in the project owners view) are the milestones that the project must accomplish before they can reach its goals and advance for further funding.

The real criteria for going from one phase to the next is that you have de-risked the project. Each milestone or task you achieve is a reduction of risk for 10x. 10x is more likely to fund $20k and $175k projects because 10x is more likely to take on early-stage risk for seed stages. As a project advances to later phases, the project will need to have removed more risks. It is essential for project teams to be able to label risks and talk about how they plan to address/get around them. Below are examples of big risk categories and its descriptions:

**Types of Risk:**
* Technology - R&D risks: Likelihood that the technology will fail testing
* Disruption - Major, unforeseeable change that will negate all plans
* Market - Time to capture market and amount of addressable market
* Financial - Likelihood that the project will run out of funding
* People - Chance that the right people will not be available to drive growth

## Phase 0 **Ideation**
10x will collect ideas from the government tech ecosystem that answers the simple question, “what problem are you trying to solve”? Initial vetting is done by 10x and the TTS Director to check and see whether the project fits TTS areas of focus / strategy. 10x will give a go/no-go decision during this initial screening process. If your 10x-backed project is selected, then it will enter our investment funnel.

## Phase 1 **Investigation** // $20k

GOAL: “A hard no or a soft yes”

Designed to quickly uncover the most salient pieces of information about the opportunities and challenges for any idea. Provides a recommendation about whether or not to provide additional funding in order to further develop each selected product idea, including reasons why a recommendation was made and what would need to change in order to reconsider the recommendation. 

What would you do with the $175k from the Discovery? Product plan?

*Big findings, broad strokes*

**Your research findings report**
* Overall feasibility of the product idea
* Current potential for market adoption inside the federal government

## Phase 2 **Discovery** // $175k
The phase usually takes about 8-10 weeks and the team will go into detail about the following topics: the industry, the problem, the product, the market, the spend plan, how you scale, your timeline, and so on. From risk to success, the project team will think comprehensively about what could go wrong and to develop a strategy around each issue your project is likely to face. The outputs of this phase is a pitch deck for the investors, 10x and the TTS Program Advisory Board (PAB), to learn about you, your project, and your team. 

* A competitive landscape analysis of similar efforts underway inside and outside the federal government
* Identification of market barriers
* Prediction of overall government market readiness

*Your presentation deck*

Keep in mind, the pitch is a relatively formal way for the PAB to learn as much about your project as possible in a short timeframe. During your presentation, amass your research for big business decisions. Provide an exit strategy story and a list of reasons why 10x should continue funding your project. Be sure to use your spend plan to drive conversation about the business plan of the project. 

## Phase 3 **Development** // $650k
This 3-4 month phase allows for teams to develop their project. Throughout phase 3, teams will begin to narrowly focus on the exit strategy to accomplish the following potential requirements:

* A functional minimum viable product (MVP)
* At least one customer actively using the product
* A meaningful, prioritized product development backlog that maps to a larger customer acquisition strategy
* A viable long-term funding model/strategy
* Market analysis/market strategy (backed by data)
* Estimate of cost and effort required to build, deploy, and maintain the product over time

Your presentation deck

## Phase 4 **Scale** // $1.28m
Significantly increasing the number of user customers on your product.
