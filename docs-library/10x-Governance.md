# How 10x Projects are Selected at every Phase
## Why do we use a phased approach?
Risk is an inherent element of new product development. The process of developing a new product or service can be seen as an act of continually de-risking a product or service by systematically identifying and addressing the risks that could keep it from succeeding.

For example, every new product or service starts with an assumption about who the target customer is and what their desires are. This assumption, while a necessary starting point, is rarely accurate enough to generate a successful product that works for its intended market. Initial user, market, and product research can help the product team adapt these initial assumptions about the target customer to reflect the reality of who the customer actually is. Doing this research de-risks future product development because an accurate understanding of the customer base removes the risk of making incorrect product development choices based on incorrect assumptions about the customer.

The goal of the 10x “incremental investment” process is to **maximize the likelihood that every project team de-risks the product or service to the greatest extent possible**, by systematically gating the financial commitment to the project based on proof that the project has addressed the clearest sources of risk at every stage. The level of risk is at its highest in early-stage projects, where a high degree of uncertainty exists about whether the product will work or not, and each subsequent phase should be able to demonstrate materially less risk in order to continue to fund the project. 

As a project advances through the phases, the project team must show that they have identified and addressed the types of project risks typical to projects at each phase. Alongside the project team, the 10x team is an active participant in helping teams identify risks associated with their project at each stage, and in ensuring that teams are able to successfully identify how these risks can best be addressed.

##What criteria are used to fund 10x projects?
As part of determining whether or not a product or service meets a real, verifiable need, 10x puts a significant emphasis on funding exploration and development of products and services that meet one or more of the following criteria:

* **Proactive support for upcoming or recently implemented law and policy**. As technology and related services have become more central to successfully enacting new laws and regulations, OPP is frequently called upon to provide implementation support for new or upcoming laws or policies. 10x actively seeks to find and fund new projects in areas of law and policy where we either have been or believe we may be asked to provide implementation support.

* **Improved support for existing law or policy**. 10x funds products or services that can demonstrate how the application of technology can meaningfully improve understanding and compliance with law and regulation.

* **Technology or process to make law, policy, or security compliance more effective and cost-efficient**. Recent technology developments can be deployed to improve the effectiveness of existing government services. 10x looks for areas to invest in where implementation of new technologies can have an outsize impact on the function or success of a product or service offered by the federal government.

* **Bringing best practices from the private sector into government**. Products and services that bring all the best of new technology and invention into the government environment. These projects focus not just on technical implementation but also do significant work to ensure that as these technologies are deployed they are fully compliant with all relevant law and policy.


## First approval: From submission to Phase 1 Investigation

Any project selected for 10x funding begins at the “Investigation” phase, a one to two week long research sprint. The goal of this first phase is to identify whether or not there are any significant blockers to the actively pursuing the project. Are there any technological hurdles that could keep the project from being successful? Are there regulatory restrictions that are too much of a challenge to overcome? Can the team locate any reason that the federal marketplace may not yet be ready to make use of the product or service proposed, or that it’s unlikely that federal agencies will be willing to pay for the product if it’s intended to be cost-recoverable?

**Criteria:**

In order to choose which submitted projects will be granted Phase 1 Investigation funding, each project is judged on the following three categories:

* *Clarity*: Is the proposal clear in its understanding and explanation of the problem to be solved?

* *Alignment*: To what degree does addressing this problem align to the TTS mission and strategy?

* *Impact*: What is the potential impact of solving this problem on each agency or person affected?

At this earliest stage, more about any given project is unknown than known, which means that the risks associated with every project at this stage will be quite high. For this reason, level of risk or degree of uncertainty about the project’s success are explicitly not a part of the decision-making process at this first stage. 

**Decision maker**: TTS Commissioner + Assistant Commissioners

**Process**: Projects are selected twice every fiscal year, ideally at the beginning of Q1 and Q3, for execution during the latter half of each quarter as well as the quarter following. The number of projects accepted depends on the spend plan developed before the year begins — ie, if 30 projects are projected for the entire year, up to 15 could be selected for Q1 and up to 15 for Q3. The number to be selected will be announced when the opening of the submission process is announced.

Each submission will be reviewed and ranked by two of TTS’s Assistant Commissioners (ACs) or to whomever they choose to delegate the selection process. The ACs chosen will be the ones whose teams are most directly related to the topic at hand. Each project will be ranked on a scale of 1-5, with one being the lowest and five being the highest, in the three categories of clarity, alignment, and impact, as described above. 

Using the average of this process, considered alongside TTS priorities and regulatory or organizational concerns, we will narrow the full list of submissions down to approximately half its initial size. The Commissioner and ACs will meet to narrow the selections down to the final selections, up to to the number specified during the initial selection announcement. Once this has been done, the submitters of the selected projects will be notified and the various contracting processes will begin.

All submissions will have names, teams, and other identifying information removed before review. Names and teams will be restored after final selections have been made.

**Requirement to Submit**: A one to two sentence idea submission answering the question “What problem are you trying to solve?”

## Second approval: From Phase 1 Investigation to Phase 2 Discovery

Projects selected for Phase 2 “Discovery” are given funding to engage in an eight- to ten-week-long in-depth product, market, and customer research study, building upon the initial research done during the “Investigation” phase in order to gain a complete picture of the market opportunity and develop a well-researched initial hypothesis regarding the the initial shape the product or service should take to meet  this market opportunity.

All projects selected for the “Investigation Phase” have tacit approval for a follow-on “Discovery” phase, assuming available funding and no significant shift in organizational priorities. Selection of projects to advance from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is based primarily on the recommendation of the project team that executes the research necessary to Phase 1, although organizational priorities, 

Assuming successful completion of this initial market and product research, as well as  a positive recommendation from the project team to continue work because no major or obvious impediments to delivering the project have been identified during the “Investigation Phase,” the
