# 10x Overview

## What is 10x?

**10x is the Office of Investments in GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS). We fund ideas from public servants for products and services that solve problems affecting the experience people have with the government.**

10x **invests in products and services that possess groundbreaking ideas or technology** with the potential for significant return on investment. We’re aiming for 10 times the value of the initial investment to the federal government or the American public, measured through cost savings, improved efficiencies, or scale of impact.

10x funds internally developed products and services that can scale widely or affect a significant portion of the U.S. population, whether or not the projects are cost-recoverable. Our approach is based on **modern venture capital practices** and is designed to **spend fewer taxpayer dollars** while also ensuring that the **best products and services** get funded. 

We look for ideas with evidence of the following:

* Your project fits into at least one of the [five TTS areas of focus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt_3web_j2573YoSC20acoY6zp80W0YPqFXaX7Jr4F0/edit#heading=h.s0xgl18fy2kx).
* Your project is in a big or rapidly growing market within the government.
* Your project supports not just the government but also the contracting ecosystem.
* Your idea directly impacts other government agencies or the American public.
* Your team is prepared for the unique challenges of developing a new product or service within the government.

## How does 10x work?

10x is the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund, a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated to support new, good-for-government products and services. 10x invests the money appropriated into this fund into new ideas with the potential for significant impact across the government. TTS will support these products and services until we find a permanent home for them within GSA or another agency.

10x is an incremental investment fund inside the federal government, which is a fancy way of saying that we start by giving you a smaller amount of money, with an expectation about what the output of spending that money should be. We use your results from that investment to determine whether or not to give you an additional, larger amount of funding for the next phase of work. 

## How is 10x different?

The traditional way the government budgets for new technology is to specify a lump sum of money for a project to be spent over a period of months or years. This approach sometimes results in continuing to spend money even after an agency or project lead determines that the project should not continue, simply because the budget already exists.

In contrast, 10x attempts to spend the smallest amount of funding necessary at each stage of a project to determine whether or not it’s worth pursuing. Only one or two of every ten projects selected for funding will make their way into design and development work. This iterative approach to investing allows us to save money while ensuring that the products and services we fund meet a real, verifiable need in the federal marketplace.

## Funding phases

Are you interested in pitching an idea for 10x? Here's what you need to know about each phase of funding.

**Phase 0 - Ideation**

Write 2–3 sentences to answer the question: “What problem are you trying to solve?” If your project is selected, it enters our investment process. 

**Phase 1 - Investigation | $20k in FY2018**

Quickly uncover risks, roadblocks, and opportunities for the project. You will have 2–3 weeks to explore the idea and define what it would take for it to be successful.

**Phase 2 - Discovery | $175k in FY2018**

Gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, product and market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, how you scale, and so on. The team will think comprehensively about what could go right and wrong, and will create an initial strategy around each issue the project may face.

**Phase 3 - Development | $650k in FY2018**

Develop a functional minimum viable product (MVP) with at least one active customer; a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy; a data-backed market analysis and strategy; a viable estimate of cost and effort required to build and maintain the product; and the beginning of a long-term plan for sustainability.

**Phase 4 - Scale | $1.28m in FY2018**

Additional funding to help you significantly increase the number of people using the product, if necessary.

## What do I need to do to get started?

To get started with any new idea, we ask that you answer one simple question in 2–3 sentences: “What problem are you trying to solve?” 10x and the TTS Director will vet ideas to determine which projects best fit within the TTS areas of focus. If your project is selected, it will enter Phase 1 of the investment process.

Making it through the funding and development process requires a significant investment of time. We need to do our due diligence to make sure we’re good stewards of taxpayer dollars, so you’ll need to justify the investment and fully develop your idea through each phase of funding.
