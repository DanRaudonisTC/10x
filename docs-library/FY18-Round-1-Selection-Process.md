# 10x Selection Process
## Selection Philosophy

Risk is an inherent element of new product development. The process of developing a new product or service can be seen as an act of continually de-risking the product or service by systematically identifying and addressing the risks that could keep it from succeeding.

For example: Every new product or service starts with an assumption about who the target customer is. Initial user, market, and product research can then help the team solidify or adapt these initial assumptions about the target customer to reflect the reality of who the customer actually is. Doing this research de-risks future product development, since an accurate understanding of the customer base removes the risk of making incorrect product development choices based on inaccurate assumptions about the customer.

The goal of the 10x “incremental investment” process is to maximize the likelihood that every project team de-risks the product or service to the greatest extent possible, by gating the financial commitment to the project based on proof that the project has addressed the clearest sources of risk at every stage. The level of risk is at its highest in early-stage projects, where a high degree of uncertainty exists about whether the product will work or not, and each subsequent phase should be able to demonstrate materially less risk in order to continue to fund the project. 

## “Investigation” Phase Selection Criteria

Any project selected for 10x funding begins at the “Investigation” phase, a one to two week long research sprint. The goal of this first phase is to identify whether or not there are any significant blockers to actively pursuing the project. Are there any technological hurdles that could keep the project from being successful? Are there regulatory restrictions that are too much of a challenge to overcome? Can the team locate any reason that the federal marketplace may not yet be ready to make use of the product or service proposed, or that it’s unlikely that federal agencies will be willing to pay for the product if it’s intended to be cost-recoverable?

At this earliest stage, more about any given project is unknown than known, which means that the risks associated with every project at this stage will be quite high. For this reason, level of risk or degree of uncertainty about the project’s success are explicitly not a part of the decision-making process at this first stage. Instead, each project is judged on the following three categories:

* *Clarity*: Is the proposal clear in its understanding and explanation of the problem to be solved?

* *Alignment*: To what degree does addressing this problem align to the TTS mission and strategy?

* *Impact*: What is the potential impact of solving this problem on each agency or person affected?

As a project advances to later phases, the project will need to be able to show that they have identified and addressed the types of project risks typical to projects at those phases. Alongside the project team, the 10x team is an active participant in helping teams identify risks associated with their project at each stage, and in ensuring that teams are able to successfully identify how these risks can best be addressed.

## “Investigation” Selection Process

Submissions will be accepted through end of day Pacific time on Friday, November 17, 2017. Final project selection will be made by Rob Cook, TTS Commissioner, with the goal of announcing up to 20 projects (up from 10) that have been selected during the week of December 4.

Prior to Rob’s final decision, each submission will be reviewed and ranked by two of TTS’s Assistant Commissioners (ACs) or to whomever they choose to delegate the selection process. The ACs chosen will be the ones whose teams are most directly related to the topic at hand, ie, Operations-related projects will get reviewed by Crystal or her delegate(s), Acquisitions-related projects will get reviewed by Alla or her delegate(s), etc. 

Each project will be ranked on a scale of 1-5, with one being the lowest and five being the highest, in the three categories of clarity, alignment, and impact, as described above. Using the average of this process, considered alongside TTS priorities and regulatory or organizational concerns, we will narrow the submissions down from 80 to up to 40 finalists. The ACs and Rob will meet for a two hour session on December 7 to narrow the selections down to the final selections, which will be up to 20 projects total. Once this has been done, the submitters of the selected projects will be notified and the various contracting processes will begin. Goal is to have any project that needs to go through the MOU process ready to execute by the beginning of Q2 FY2018—other projects may be able to begin sooner or later than that, depending on how the person running the project chooses to spend the money executing it.

All submissions will have names, teams, and other identifying information removed before review. Names and teams will be restored after final selections have been made.
