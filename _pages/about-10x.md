10x is an incremental investment fund inside the United States federal government. We fund internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.

We focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov), and the [TTS Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/tts).

Our funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x is a program that lives within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and is managed by the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs).

<h2 class="docs-h2">Calls for ideas</h2>

10x is currently accepting ideas to be considered for funding from Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) employees.  The window to submit your idea is open until June 1, 2018.

As we scale this program, 10x will be open to submissions from the entire federal government.

<h2 class="docs-h2">10x privacy policy</h2>

### Information you send us as an idea
Federal employees can voluntarily send us information as part of a pitch for 10x funding by sending an email message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or by submitting a project idea through [our online form]({{ site.submission_form }}). This information will be shared with subject-matter experts and the 10x Program Advisory Board in order to make funding decisions. We publish information about which ideas do and do not receive funding, along with the date of submission and the organization where the idea originated from. If your idea is accepted for funding, your name and home agency will be listed on our website. In some cases, we might feature your actual idea on our website for teaching and promotion purposes.

We cannot accept ideas from the general public. If you are **not** a federal employee and you submit an idea for funding, we’ll only use your information to reply to your message. We will not keep the information you sent as part of your pitch.

### Everything else
For everything else, we follow the practices outlined in GSA’s [privacy and security notice](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/privacy-and-security-notice).
