10x is an incremental investment fund inside the United States federal government. We provide seed funding for internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.

We focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](#0), [Federalist](#0), and the [bug bounty program](#0).

Our funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the <a href="#1">Federal Citizen Services Fund</a> designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x (officially, The Office of Investments in the General Services Administration’s Office of Products and Programs) is the management vehicle of that fund.
