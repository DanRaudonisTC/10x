<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-5">Information you send us as a pitch</h2>

Federal employees can voluntarily send us information as part of a pitch for 10x funding by sending an email message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or by submitting a project idea through our online form. This information can be shared with subject-matter experts and the 10x Program Advisory Board in order to make funding decisions. We publish information about which ideas do and do not receive funding, along with the date of submission and the organization where the idea originated from. If your idea is accepted for funding, only your name and home agency will be listed on our website.

We cannot accept ideas from the general public. If you are not a federal employee and you submit an idea for funding, we’ll only use your information to reply to your message. We will not keep the information you sent as part of your pitch.

<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-5">Everything else</h2>
For everything else, we follow the practices outlined in GSA’s [privacy and security notice](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/privacy-and-security-notice).
