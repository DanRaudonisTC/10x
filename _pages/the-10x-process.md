<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-5">Overview</h2>

- First, 10x collects a broad range of ideas.
- Then we select ideas based on their potential impact and scalability.
- Finally, 10x funds each selected idea in phases, as the project matures.


<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-6">Collect a broad range of ideas</h2>

10x believes that federal civil servants — with their front row view to the inner workings of our government — are uniquely positioned to identify the key problems that impede our government from achieving its mission. 10x aims to uncover and elevate the most promising ideas from the federal workforce.

To do this, we explore a lot of ideas at once with a small initial investment in each. The goal is to identify the immediate opportunities as well as the risks that an idea might present without spending too much money too quickly. This approach enables us to identify the ideas and approaches to solving a problem that are most likely to have an impact within a matter of weeks.

Each subsequent stage of funding allows for a greater investment into an idea, and requires project teams to continue to prove potential impact and demonstrate that a project can thrive. This way, only the best ideas receive large investments, and we avoid spending millions of taxpayer dollars on ideas that won’t work.

<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-6">How 10x selects projects</h2>

When the submission period ends on June 1, 2018, 10x will go to work evaluating all the ideas from this period and recommending a selection of those ideas for its incremental project funding.

Your idea will be evaluated based on the following 3 criteria, each given equal weight:

<ul class="line-height-small tablet:line-height-base">
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Clarity.</strong> Does the idea understand and explain a real problem?</li>
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Alignment.</strong> Does the idea help develop new, good-for-government technology?</li>
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Impact.</strong> Does solving this problem have an important effect on the federal government or the public?</li>
</ul>

<p>If selected, 10x starts its funding small — only magnifying its investment <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/the-10x-process.md %}">as an idea develops, step-by-step, into a sustainable project</a>. This iterative approach, based on modern technology and investment practices, ensures that the best ideas turn into the best government products and services — funded with fewer taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>10x projects are managed and staffed by project teams within the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services">Techology Transformation Services</a> department of the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/">General Services Administration</a>.</p>

<aside>
  <h3 id="stage-1-identify">Identify a problem</h3>
  <p>Point to the pain. We start by gathering pitches from federal civil servants. <em>Any federal employee can pitch an idea</em>, and your level of involvement in the work if your idea is selected is up to you. These pitch proposals are intentionally short, only about 2–3 sentences, to stay focused on a specific, concrete problem.</p>

  <h3 id="stage-2-investigation-20k">Phase 1: Investigation — $20,000</h3>
  <p>Think it through. Accepted pitches spend 2-3 weeks exploring the idea to define what it would take to be successful — uncovering risks, roadblocks, and opportunities. At this point, people who submit ideas are expected to act as subject matter experts and, if possible, work alongside a research team inside of the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). </p>

  <h3 id="stage-3-discovery-175k">Phase 2: Discovery — $175,000</h3>
  <p>Go deep. Gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, and how to scale. Analyze what could go right and wrong, and create an initial strategy to address these issues.</p>

  <h3 id="stage-4-development-650k">Phase 3: Development — $650,000</h3>
  <p>Build it out and plan for the future. Develop a functional minimum viable product with at least one active customer. Create a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy. Provide a data-backed market analysis. Estimate the cost and effort required to continue sustainably building and maintaining the product over the long-term.</p>

  <h3 id="stage-5-scale-1-25m">Phase 4: Scale — $1.28 million</h3>
  <p>Bring the product or service to the largest possible audience.</p>
</aside>

<h2 class="margin-bottom-5 border-top-p5 padding-top-2 margin-top-6">Project ownership</h2>

10x sits in the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) at GSA, and TTS manages the Digital Services Fund. That means that all 10x projects, regardless of where they originated, are owned by TTS. Your TTS Sponsor will be someone who believes in your idea and will serve as the product manager to shepherd the project to success. Your role will be that of a subject matter expert and you can be involved in the process as much or as little as you are able. TTS has expertise in product ownership and will be the default home of any deliverables or outcomes of your project; however, our team will advocate for any project deliverables to live in the most logical place.

You do not need a sponsor to submit an idea to 10x. If your project is accepted for funding, we will connect you with a sponsor.
