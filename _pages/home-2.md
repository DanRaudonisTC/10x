<p class="font-sans-f11 font-weight-200 margin-top-0" id="what-is-10x">Seed funding for high-impact ideas</p>

10x is an incremental investment fund inside the United States federal government. We provide seed funding for internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.

We focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants — supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere.

Our funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the <a href="#1">Federal Citizen Services Fund</a> designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x (officially, The Office of Investments in the General Services Administration’s Office of Products and Programs) is the management vehicle of that fund.

<p class="font-sans-f11 font-weight-200 margin-top-0" id="what-is-10x">Start smart, start small</p>

We believe in starting smart and starting small — magnifying our investments as a project's proven needs grow.

Instead of investing with a single large lump sum, we start with smaller exploratory investments to help decide whether larger investments are needed at later project stages. This approach, based on modern venture capital practices, ensures that the best products and services get funded with fewer taxpayer dollars. Even successful projects may not require the largest, most expensive stages.

<h3 id="stage-1-identify">Stage 1: Identify a problem</h3>
<p>Point to the pain. We start by gathering pitches from federal civil servants. <em><a href="#who-can-pitch">Any federal employee can pitch an idea</a></em>. These pitch proposals are intentionally short, only about 2–3 sentences, to stay focused on a specific, concrete problem.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2-investigation-20k">Stage 2: Investigation — $20,000</h3>
<p>Think it through. Accepted pitches spend 2-3 weeks exploring the idea to define what it would take to be successful — uncovering risks, roadblocks, and opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="stage-3-discovery-175k">Stage 3: Discovery — $175,000</h3>
<p>Go deep. Gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, and how to scale. Analyze what could go right and wrong, and create an initial strategy to address these issues.</p>

<h3 id="stage-4-development-650k">Stage 4: Development — $650,000</h3>
<p>Build it out and plan for the future. Develop a functional minimum viable product with at least one active customer. Create a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy. Provide a data-backed market analysis. Estimate the cost and effort required to continue sustainably building and maintaining the product over the long-term.</p>

<h3 id="stage-5-scale-1-25m">Stage 5: Scale — $1.25 million</h3>
<p>If necessary, significantly increase the number of people using the product or service.</p>
