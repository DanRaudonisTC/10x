# How 10x Works

10x is an incremental investment fund inside the federal government, which is a fancy way of saying that we start by giving you a smaller amount of money, with an expectation about what the output of spending that money should be. We use your results from that investment to determine whether or not to give you an additional, larger amount of funding for the next phase of work.

## How is this different?

The traditional way the government budgets for new technology is to specify a lump sum of money for a project to be spent over a period of months or years. This approach sometimes results in continuing to spend money even after an agency or project lead determines that the project should not continue, simply because the budget already exists.

In contrast, 10x attempts to spend the smallest amount of funding necessary at each stage of a project to determine whether or not itâ€™s worth pursuing. Only one or two of every ten projects selected for funding will make their way into design and development work. This iterative approach to investing allows us to save money while ensuring that the products and services we fund meet a real, verifiable need in the federal marketplace.

## Where does the money come from?

10x is the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund, a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated to support new, good-for-government products and services. 10x invests the money appropriated into this fund into new ideas with the potential for significant impact across the government. 

## Where do these projects live?

The Office of Products and Programs, part of the Technology Transformation Service, is the custodian of all products and services built through the 10x process, and makes the final determination about how a product or service will be supported once it has been successfully developed. TTS supports these products and services until we find a permanent home for them either within TTS, within GSA, or another agency.
