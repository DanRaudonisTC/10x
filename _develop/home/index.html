<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="what-is-10x">What is 10x?</h2>

<p>10x is the Office of Investments in GSA’s Office of Products and Programs. We provide seed funding for internal government projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly impact and improve how government builds technology for the public good. </p>

<p>Officially, we are the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund, a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. We focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants when their own offices might not have the capacity or resources.</p>

<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="the-process">The 10x process</h2>
<p>10x is an incremental investment fund inside the federal government, products and services developed in and by the government that can scale widely or affect a significant portion of the U.S. population, whether or not the projects are cost-recoverable.</p>

<p>Instead of investing in projects on one lump, we start with small exploratory investments to help decide whether larger investments are needed. Our approach is based on modern venture capital practices and is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while also ensuring that the best products and services get funded.</p>

<h3 id="0-pitch-what-problem-are-you-trying-to-solve-">0. Pitch: What problem are you trying to solve?</h3>
<p>We start by gathering pitches from federal civil servants. <em><a href="#who-can-pitch">Any federal employee pitch an idea</a></em>. Proposals are intentionally short, about 2–3 sentences, to keep them focused on a concrete problem.</p>
<h3 id="1-investigation-20k">1. Investigation: $20,000</h3>
<p>Quickly uncover risks, roadblocks, and opportunities for the project. You
will have 2–3 weeks to explore the idea and define what it would take for
it to be successful.</p>
<h3 id="2-discovery-175k">2. Discovery: $175,000</h3>
<p>Gain a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, product and
market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, how you scale, and
so on. The team will think comprehensively about what could go right and
wrong, and will create an initial strategy around each issue the project
may face.</p>
<h3 id="3-development-650k">3. Development: $650,000</h3>
<p>Develop a functional minimum viable product (MVP) with at least
one active customer; a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition
strategy; a data-backed market analysis and strategy; a viable estimate of
cost and eort required to build and maintain the product; and the
beginning of a long-term plan for sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="4-scale-1-25m">4. Scale: $1.25 million</h3>
<p>Additional funding to help you significantly increase the number
of people using the product, if necessary.</p>

<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="who-can-pitch">Who can pitch ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>all federal employees</li>
<li>we can help pair you with a government technologist</li>
<li>point to how to pitch</li>
</ul>
<p>Have an idea? <a href="#pitch">Our call for proposals is open until [date].</a> Need help putting your pitch together? <a href="">We can help pair you with someone with technical and user-centered design expertise.</a></p>

<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="what-we-look-for">What we look for</h2>

<ul>
<li>Impact across the federal government or the American public.</li>
<li>Improve the public’s experience with government through technology.</li>
<li>Improves how government builds and shares technology to better serve the public.</li>
<li>Projects that are in a big or rapidly growing market in government technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="impact">Program impact &amp; case studies</h2>

<p><i>{How much we want in this section depends on how quickly we want to put together the finance+program impact page}</i></p>

<p>10x has funded many successful initiatives to improve the way the federal government uses technology. Here are a few of their stories:</p>

<p><em>{case studies}</em></p>

<h2 class="border-top-g05 margin-top-g4" id="pitch-us">Sending us your ideas.</h2>

<p><em>{What if we created either an email list for people to get notified for when pitches open *or</em> a public google calendar that people can subscribe to for when call for proposals open?}*</p>
