    <p><a href="process"><strong>Funding Model</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="process"><strong>Investment Philosophy</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="process"><strong>Project Logistics</strong></a></p>

<p>10x is an incremental investment fund inside the federal government, which is a fancy way of saying that we start by giving you a smaller amount of money, with an expectation about what the output of spending that money should be. We use your results from that investment to determine whether or not to give you an additional, larger amount of funding for the next phase of work, a process that can continue through up to four phases.</p>

<h2 id="funding-model">Funding Model</h2>

<h3 id="funnel-needs-graphic">Funnel (Needs graphic)</h3>

<p>There are five separate funding phases:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 0 - Ideation</strong><br /> Write 2–3 sentences to answer the question: “What problem are you trying to solve?” If your project is selected, it enters our investment process.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Phase 1 - Investigation</td>
      <td>$20k in FY2018** <br />This phase is designed to quickly uncover risks, roadblocks, and opportunities for the project. You will have 2–3 weeks to explore the idea and define what it would take for it to be successful.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Phase 2 - Discovery</td>
      <td>$175k in FY2018** <br /> A weeks-long research effort to develop a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, product and market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, how you scale, and so on. The team will think comprehensively about what could go right and wrong, and will develop an initial strategy around each issue the project may face.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Phase 3 - Development</td>
      <td>$650k in FY2018** <br />Develop the product or service and begin to narrowly focus on a long-term sustainability strategy. This phase includes the development of a functional minimum viable product (MVP); at least one customer actively using the product; a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy; a long-term funding model; a data-backed market analysis and strategy; and a viable estimate of cost and effort required to design, build, deploy, and maintain the product over time.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Phase 4 - Scale</td>
      <td>$1.28m in FY2018** <br /> If necessary, additional funding to help you significantly increase the number of people using the product.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="how-is-this-different">How is this different?</h3>

<p>The traditional way the government budgets for new technology is to specify a lump sum of money for a project to be spent over a period of months or years. This approach sometimes results in continuing to spend money even after an agency or project lead determines that the project should not continue, simply because the budget already exists.</p>

<p>In contrast, 10x attempts to spend the smallest amount of funding necessary at each stage of a project to determine whether or not it’s worth pursuing. Only one or two of every ten projects selected for funding will make their way into design and development work. This iterative approach to investing allows us to save money while ensuring that the products and services we fund meet a real, verifiable need in the federal marketplace.</p>

<h3 id="where-does-the-money-come-from">Where does the money come from?</h3>

<p>10x is the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund, a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated to support new, good-for-government products and services. 10x invests the money appropriated into this fund into new ideas with the potential for significant impact across the government.</p>

<h2 id="investment-philosophy">Investment Philosophy</h2>

<p>Some stuff here about our risk model. Kill untenable ideas quickly and inexpensively</p>

<h2 id="project-logistics">Project Logistics</h2>

<h3 id="where-do-these-projects-live">Where do these projects live?</h3>

<p>The Office of Products and Programs, part of the Technology Transformation Service, is the custodian of all products and services built through the 10x process, and makes the final determination about how a product or service will be supported once it has been successfully developed. TTS supports these products and services until we find a permanent home for them either within TTS, within GSA, or another agency.</p>
